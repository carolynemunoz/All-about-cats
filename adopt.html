          <h3> What To Know Before Adopting </h3>

          <p> Before adopting a cat it's important to know that it's a great responsibility. Once you adopt a cat they're become your responsibility for up to 15-20 years. </p>

          <p> In order to be able to adopt a cat you should  also be financially prepared. Cats are also a financial responsibility and require a lot of money and care. Such as vet bills, food, toys, litter, medications, and grooming. </p>

          <p> After you're sure you can handle the responsiblity, you also have to keep in mind cats are animals and have a natural instinct to scratch, climb, and run around, especially kittens. Cats can be trained but remember to be patient and understanding. </p>

          <h3> Choosing a Cat </h3>

          <p> There's many different options when adopting a cat. It all comes down to what you're looking for ! </p>

          <p> Some things to take into consideration when adopting a cat is age, gender, breed, their behavorial history, medical history. An important question to ask when adopting at a shelter or rescue is whether or not the cat is spayed/neutered. Usually they always are, but if not it would be another cost to add. </p> 

          <p> Many shelters also provide descriptions on the different cats. It's important to read them to learn about their personality. Many cats have different needs and it's important to take their needs into consideration. Such as some not being kid friendly, or not wanting to be around other animals. Some cats might come bonded which means you can't seperate them and would have to adopt both of them. </p>

          <h3> Different Types of Cats </h3>

          <p> There are many different types of cats at shelters. Usually a lot of people looking to adopt a cat are looking specifically for kittens. While kittens are cute and snuggly, they require a lot of training and attention, if you have the time available to do this then they would be a perfect match for you! </p>

          <p> However if you're looking for a more mellow and calm cat, you should consider a older cat. Older cats at shelters usually have been there for a long time :( . If you want a more quiet companion to accompany you without having to worry about litter training them, than an older cat might be the one for you! </p> 

          <p> The most common difference between cats are the length of their coats. Short haired cats aren't as much maintenance as a longer haired cat would be since you would have to also pay for grooming, which is a added cost and another important thing to take in consideration. </p>
