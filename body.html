        <h3>Chill Guy Cat </h3>
        <p> When a cat is happy, their pupils  will become dilated and their eyes will widen. Having my ears faced upwards is a good sign as well. However, if I show you my stomach this is not an invitation to rub it, rather it is a sign that I feel safe and trust you! Cats will purr in use of expression to let you know they want head rubs and your attention</p>

        <h3> "Aye Mis Gatos" (Scared cat) </h3>
       <p> When a cat is scared, to make themselves smaller they will crouch low to be closer to the ground. In comparison to when a cat is angry, when a cat feels intimidated, its ears will be angled backwards or sideways while their pupils will become dilated and widen. If the cat begins to hiss or growl, it is best to just retreat as further engagement may lead to the cat resorting to aggression. </p>
